## 35.
When all the jobs are completed, delete the cluster from the list, start up another cluster to check that all the files for the other days were generated properly. If not, make sure you submit any additional jobs to complete the processing.

> Include screenshots showing the correct number of files for `20181101` and `20181102`. In addition, include a screenshot showing the number of hickle files for each of the days without neural data (refer to Part 10 - Step 70 in Lab 5 for the expected number per day) in your lab report.

You can now update the snapshot from your EC2 instance, and shut down the cluster.

In this lab, you have gone through some of the basics of optimizing a data processing pipeline. In the next lab, you will learn about high-throughput data visualization.
