# Part 1. Update files from GitHub

## 1.
For this lab, you can opt to use the scripts you created in Lab 4 if you did not have any problems. However, we have also added a version of the scripts to the PyHipp repository, so if you would like to use those versions instead, you will need to rename your version so it does not create a conflict when you merge the changes in the upstream repository into your local repository (remember to create a cluster from your EC2 instance and not your computer):

```shell
(env1) [ec2-user@ip-10-0-5-43 PyHipp] $ mv rplparallel-slurm.sh myrplparallel-slurm.sh
```

The same goes for these other scripts you created in Lab 4:

```shell
rplsplit-slurm.sh   checkfiles.sh
rs1-slurm.sh        removefiles.sh
rs2-slurm.sh        checkfiles2.sh
rs3-slurm.sh        pipe2.sh
rs4-slurm.sh
```

> If you choose to use the files in the upstream repository, remember to replace the AWS account number used in these scripts with your own account number. 


You can then merge your repository with the changes in the upstream repository:

```shell
(env1) [ec2-user@ip-10-0-5-43 PyHipp] $ git fetch upstream

(env1) [ec2-user@ip-10-0-5-43 PyHipp] $ git checkout main

(env1) [ec2-user@ip-10-0-5-43 PyHipp] $ git merge upstream/main
```

You can add your versions of the scripts to your GitHub repository (remember to set the default editor to nano as in Lab 4):

```shell
(env1) [ec2-user@ip-10-0-5-43 PyHipp] $ git add my*.sh

(env1) [ec2-user@ip-10-0-5-43 PyHipp] $ git commit

```

You can push all the changes to your repository by doing:
```shell
(env1) [ec2-user@ip-10-0-5-43 PyHipp] $ git push
```

You will then be prompted to enter your GitHub username and token again.
